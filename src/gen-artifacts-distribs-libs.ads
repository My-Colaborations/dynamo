--  The <b>Gen.Artifacts.Distribs.Libs</b> package provides a specific
--  distribution rule which gather the shared libraries used by executables
--  and put them in a target distribution directory.
--
--  <install mode='libs' dir='lib'>
--    <library>libgnat</library>
--    <library>libmysql*</library>
--    <fileset dir="bin">
--        <include name="*-server"/>
--    </fileset>
--  </install>
--
--  Libraries to copy in the distribution are specified in the <b>library</b>
--  rule description.  The library name must match the pattern defined.
--
--  The command works by executing the Unix application <b>ldd</b> on the
--  executable.  It parses the <b>ldd</b> output and collects the libraries
--  that the program is using.  It then copies the selected libraries
--  in the target directory.

   --  and copy a selected subset in the target directory.
